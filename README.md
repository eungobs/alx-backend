This repository contains solutions for the tasks related to internationalization and localization (i18n) in Flask applications. Each task focuses on different aspects of i18n, from basic setup to more advanced features like handling user preferences and time zones.

Setup
To run the Flask applications in this repository, you'll need to have Python and Flask installed on your system. Additionally, some tasks require the installation of the Flask-Babel extension. You can install it via pip:

$ pip3 install flask_babel==2.0.0

Task 1: Basic Babel setup
Set up Babel Flask extension and configure available languages as English and French.
Task 2: Get locale from request
