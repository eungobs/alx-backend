# Queuing System in JavaScript

This project is a queuing system implemented in JavaScript using Node.js and Redis. It provides a set of functionalities to interact with a Redis server, manage job queues, and process tasks asynchronously.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Node.js 12.x
- Redis 5.0.7

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/<username>/alx-backend.git

Navigate to the project directory:cd alx-backend/0x03-queuing_system_in_js

Install dependencies:npm install

Usage
0. Install a Redis instance
Download, extract, and compile the latest stable Redis version higher than 5.0.7 from redis.io. Then start Redis in the background and make sure it's working correctly.

1. Node Redis Client
Install the node_redis package using npm. Write a script to connect to the Redis server and log the connection status.

2. Node Redis client and basic operations
Write a script to perform basic Redis operations like setting and getting values using callbacks.

3. Node Redis client and async operations
Modify the previous script to use ES6 async/await with promisify to perform async operations.

4. Node Redis client and advanced operations
Write a script to store hash values in Redis and display them using Redis commands.

5. Node Redis client publisher and subscriber
Create Redis clients for publishing and subscribing to messages on specific channels. Messages are sent and received asynchronously.

6. Create the Job creator
Implement a job creator that creates job queues using Kue, adds jobs to the queues, and handles job completion and failure.

7. Create the Job processor
Create a job processor to process jobs from the queues, perform tasks based on job data, and handle job completion, failure, and progress.

8. Track progress and errors with Kue: Create the Job creator
Write a function to create job queues and add jobs to the queues. Implement tests to validate job creation functionality.

9. Track progress and errors with Kue: Create the Job processor
Create a job processor to process jobs from the queues, track progress, handle errors, and update job statuses.

10. Writing the job creation function
Write a function to create job queues and add jobs to the queues. Create a script to test job creation functionality.

11. Writing the test for job creation
Write tests for the job creation function to ensure it works as expected. Use test mode to validate job creation and completion.

12. In stock?
Implement an API to manage product inventory using Redis. It provides endpoints to list products, get product details, and reserve products.

13. Can I have a seat?
Implement a seat reservation system using Redis and Kue. It allows users to reserve seats and tracks the number of available seats.
